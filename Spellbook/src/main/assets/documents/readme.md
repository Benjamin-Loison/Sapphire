# Purpose of Spellbook
It is a bridge between Linux and Android. It is your mobile workstation for editing and configuring anything within the Sapphire Framework, from on Android itself. Hopefully, it also acts as a good workstation for developing Android apps as well

Spellbook holds all essential documents for understanding the Ecosystem. It is also a place for helping with manual testing of things like scripts, voice commands (push button), and for some simple settings. 

See the [index](index.md) for more information

# Understanding Android Development
THe assets directory can act as a /home/ directory, because the file structure is saved, and the data is raw. I would be worried about compression, but I'm expecting this app to be a few gigs anyway, so I'll worry about shrinking it later, when I know where the hotspots are. This should mean the above index link should be valid.
