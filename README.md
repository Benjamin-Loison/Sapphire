# Athena
Athena is an open source Google Assistant replacement, that doesn't require any Google services to run

# Motivation
Athena was developed to meet the needs of the open source community, while offering quality alternatives to producs in the closed source world. My original goal was simply to find a flexible mobile assistant that I could develop features for to help manage my ADHD. Finding nothing on the market to meet my need, that also respected the ethics of free and opoen source software, I decided to start developing my own. It started out as a port of Mycroft for Android but due to system differences it quickly turned into its own project under the title "The Sapphire Assistant Framework". However I was concerned the flexibility and configuration of the Sapphire Framework might overwhelm non-technical users so I decided to trim down the code and create a default implementation that would work out of the box for 99% of users. Thus, Athena was born.
