# Sapphire
Sapphire is an open source Google Assistant replacement, that doesn't require any Google services to run

# Motivation
Sapphire was developed to meet the needs of the open source community, while offering quality alternatives to producs in the closed source world. My original goal was simply to find a flexible mobile assistant that I could develop features for to help manage my ADHD. Finding nothing on the market to meet my need that also respected the ethics of free and open source software, I decided to start developing my own. It started out as a port of Mycroft for Android but due to system differences it quickly turned into its own project under the title "The Sapphire Assistant Framework". However I was concerned the flexibility and configuration of the Sapphire Framework might overwhelm non-technical users so I decided to trim down the code and create a default implementation that would work out of the box for 99% of users. Thus, Sapphire was born.

# Contributions
* Join in the community on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SapphireFramework) or Matrix at #SapphireFramework:matrix.org
* Android, Machine Learning developers, and UI/UX developers would be greatly appreciated for the project (guidance is always appreciated). I will continue to move forward reguardless, but it will go a lot quicker with some domain specific expertise.
* Documentation help would be greatly appreciated. I generally have all of the information locked up in my head and I am working on documentation, but sometimes I miss what others would find helpful or need more information on. Feel free to ask questions on Reddit or Matrix (I'm pretty responsive) if you would like to help out
